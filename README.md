# company-sclang-backend
really simplistic attempt at a supercollider completion backend for company-mode in emacs

not knowing `company-mode` all that well and not super-familiar with writing emacs packages,... a really simplistic take on a SuperCollider backend for `company-mode` based on [this](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/wiki/Writing-backends) example using `sclang-symbol-table`
